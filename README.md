# textmining-survey


This is a dashboard with text-data frequency charts in R shiny,
based on a class assignment's text data generated from students' audio responses with Microsoft speech recognition.
The data was collected and transformed to a text corpus and tokenized. 

This assignment was aimed to imporve MyCourses with text analytics/natural language processing (NLP).
The method can be applied to other survey response dataset and to serve other business purposes.


The information collected and analyzed from the simple survey includes gender, age, 'likes' & 'hates' about MyCourses, positive or negative attitude to MyCourses.
